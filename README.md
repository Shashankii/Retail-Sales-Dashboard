# 🛍️ Retail Sales Performance Dashboard 

## 📘 Project Description

The **Retail Sales Performance Dashboard** is an end-to-end Power BI project designed to bring clarity and visibility into key sales performance metrics of a retail business. It simulates a real-time analytics solution for a fast-growing retail brand (like Zepto), allowing decision-makers to monitor business-critical KPIs across geography, time, and product hierarchy.

By integrating visual storytelling with analytical depth, the dashboard transforms raw transactional data into actionable insights. The project focuses on delivering a highly interactive and accessible analytics experience to non-technical business users, driving smarter decision-making at all organizational levels.

- Provides real-time insights into regional and category-wise performance
